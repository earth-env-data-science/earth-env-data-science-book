# Intro to Git for Version Control

## Overview

[_Version control_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control) is a powerful way to organize, back up, and share with collaborators your research computing code.
A Verson control system keeps track of a set of files and saves snapshots (i.e. _versions_, _commits_) of the files at any point in time. 
Using version control allows you to confidently make changes to your code (any any other files), with the ability to roll back to any previous state. This help avoid filling our directories up with files that look like this:

    my_code.py
    my_code_version2.py
    my_code_version2B-RPA-edit.py
    my_code_FINAL_VERSION.py
    my_code_THIS_IS_ACTUALLY_THE FINAL VERSION.py

Version control also allows you to share code with collaborators, make simultaneous edits, and merge your changes in a systematic, controlled way.

Version control has been used for a long time in software development.
More recently, it has become an essential part of modern data and computational science.
Our strong recommendation is that _all of your research code be stored in a version control system_. 

The tool we will be using for version control is called [Git](https://git-scm.com).
Git is incredibly powerful--it also has a somewhat steep learning curve.
Fortunately, in this class, we will only be using a small subset of what git can do, avoiding the more complex aspects.

For a full-length tutorial, we recommend the article [Version Control with Git](http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/) on Software Carpentry website.
Here we simply enumerate the most common git commands.


## Summary of useful Git commands

Set up your username and email

    git config --global user.name "Ryan Abernathey"
    git config --global user.email "rpa@ldeo.columbia.edu"


Create a new repository:

    cd my_project
    git init      

Stage files for addition to the repository:

    git add <filenames>  

Commit staged files:


    git commit -m "your brief commit message goes here"

Get information about your repository:

    git status    # tells you what files are staged, which ones have been modified, are new,... )
    git log       # view the commit log
    git diff      # view file content differences


Revert a file to an earlier version:

    git checkout <commit tag> <filenames>


## Collaborating with Git and Github

* Create a new repository on GitHub
* Follow the instructions and run `git remote add origin <repo url>` on your local repo
* make your changes and stage them with `git add`,
* commit your changes with `git commit -m`, and
* upload the changes to GitHub with` git push origin master`
* update your local repo with `git pull origin master`
