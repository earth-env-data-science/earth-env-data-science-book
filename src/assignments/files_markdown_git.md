# Assignment: Files, Git, and Github

## Create a Dummy Resume Repository

Use JupyterLab to launch a terminal and use the terminal to do the following tasks:

1. Create a new directory called `resume` within your home directory
2. Create an empty file within this directory called `Readme.md`

Now use JupyterLab to edit the file:

1. Navigate to the directory in the file browser
1. Open `Readme.md` in the text editor
1. Open `Readme.md` in in Markdown Preview
1. Arrange these files side-by-side so you can see your document rendered
1. Edit the file in the editor. Add the following information:

    1. Top level heading with your name
    1. An image. It can be a photo of you or, if you prefer, a photo of your spirit animal.
    1. Secondary heading entitled "Education"
    1. A list of schools you attended, hyperlinked to the websites of those insitutions

1. Save the file
    
Now go back to the terminal and do the following:

1. Initialize a new git repository in the `resume` directory
1. Add the `Readme.md` file to the repository
1. Create a new commit with a commit message
1. Check the git log to see your commit history
1. Go to GitHub and create a [new public repository](https://github.com/new) entitled `resume`
1. Push your local resume repository to GitHub following the instructions.
1. View your online resume at `http://github.com/<your github username>/resume`

Finally, go back to the editor and add a new subsection called "Research Interests" to your `Readme.md` file. Update your local git repository and push your changes to GitHub. Verify that the remote repository is updated.

To "hand in" this part of the assignment, put a link to it in the `Readme.md` file in the next part.


## Create your Assignments Repository

Now that you know how to create a git repository, you should create your assignments repository.

- Create a new directory called `rces-assignments` in your home directory.
- Create a `Readme.md` markdown file that contains your name and a link to your "resume" repo.
- Initialize a new git repository 
- Add the file and make your first commit
- Create a new **private** repository on GitHub called `rces-assignments`. (Call it exactly like that. Do not vary the spelling, capitalization, or punctuation.)
- Push your `rces-assignments` repository to GitHub
- On GitHub, go to "settings" -> "collaborators" and add `tjcrone` and `taoma0528`.
- Push new commits to this repository whenever you are ready to hand in your assignments
